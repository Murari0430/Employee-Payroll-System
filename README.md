Employee Payroll System
This project presents a robust and user-friendly Employee Payroll System, developed to efficiently manage employee information and automate critical payroll calculations. Built with a strong emphasis on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, this system provides a centralized platform for handling various aspects of employee data, from personal details to complex salary computations.

Purpose:

The primary goal of this system is to streamline the payroll process for businesses, reducing manual errors and saving time. It aims to provide accurate salary calculations, manage deductions, and maintain comprehensive records for each employee, ensuring compliance and transparency in financial operations.

Key Features:

Employee Management:

Add New Employee: Register new employees with essential details such as Employee ID, Full Name, Contact Information, Department, Designation, Date of Joining, and initial Salary.

View Employee Details: Retrieve and display comprehensive profiles for individual employees or a list of all registered employees.

Update Employee Information: Modify existing employee records (e.g., change department, update salary, alter contact details).

Delete Employee Record: Remove an employee's data from the system.

Search Employee: Efficiently locate employees by ID, name, or department.

Payroll Processing:

Salary Calculation: Automate the calculation of gross salary based on the employee's base pay.

Deduction Management: Apply various deductions (e.g., taxes, provident fund, insurance premiums) to calculate net pay.

Generate Payslips: Create detailed payslips for each employee, showing gross pay, itemized deductions, and net pay.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts Applied:

The system is designed using core OOP principles to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability:

Encapsulation: Employee and Payroll data are encapsulated within dedicated classes (e.g., Employee, PayrollRecord), with private attributes accessed only via public getter and setter methods. This protects data integrity and simplifies interactions.

Abstraction: Users interact with high-level functionalities (e.g., "Process Payroll," "Add Employee") without needing to understand the intricate underlying logic or data structures.

Inheritance: The system can be easily extended to support different types of employees (e.g., SalariedEmployee, HourlyEmployee, Manager) that inherit common properties and behaviors from a base Employee class, while implementing their specific payroll rules.

Polymorphism: Allows for uniform handling of diverse employee types. For instance, a calculateNetPay() method could be invoked on a collection of Employee objects, with the specific implementation (e.g., tax calculation rules) being determined by the actual type of employee object at runtime.

Technology Stack:

Language: Java

Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming

Environment: Console-based application (expandable to GUI)

This Employee Payroll System serves as a practical demonstration of how OOP principles can be leveraged to build a structured, efficient, and easily extensible application for managing essential HR and financial tasks.
